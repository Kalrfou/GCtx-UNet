# GCtx-UNet: Efficient Deep Network for Medical Image Segmentation

#### GCtx-UNet is a U-shaped network architecture that incorporates the Global Context Vision Transformer (GC-ViT) to enhance medical image segmentation by effectively capturing both global and local features. Feel free to check out our preprint on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.05891). &#8291;

##  Prepare data
The Synapse and ACDC datasets we used are provided by the authors of TransUnet. You can access the processed data through this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ACJEoTp-uqfFJ73qS3eUObQh52nGuzCd). For more details, please refer to the "./datasets/README.md" file. Alternatively, you can go ahead and request the preprocessed data by emailing jienengchen01@gmail.com. If you use the preprocessed data, please ensure it is solely for research purposes and do not redistribute it by TransUnet's License.
##  Environment
- Please prepare an environment with python=3.8, and then use the command "pip install -r requirements.txt" for the dependencies.

##  Train/Test
### 1) Train
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0  python -W ignore train.py 
```
### 2) Testing
#### Get pre-trained GCtx-UNet model weights for the Synapse dataset:  [link](https://panthers-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/tzhao_uwm_edu/ER6J2LwtirFOip2m6u7hQt8BBdph8P2OrfI_Wmj8MNMQfg?e=7uiftc)
download the file and put it into the folder model_out.

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0  python -W ignore test.py --is_saveni
```
